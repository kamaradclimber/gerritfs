# Gerritfs

This gem allows to mount a gerrit as a filesystem. It aims to improve UX to operate reviews.

Usage
-----

```
mkdir /tmp/gerrit
bin/mount /tmp/gerrit gerrit.yml
```

where gerrit.yml contains:

```
base_url: http://gerrit.mydomain
username: a.username
password: my_gerrit_http_password # see your preference
```

Tree mapping (intent, most of it not implemented yet)
------------

- **/my** contains a list of reviews grouped by projects and a file named **dashboard**
 - **/my/dashboard** contains a small recap of all reviews with their status (score, verified)
 - **/my/[group]/[project]/** contains a folder per review
- **/projects** contains one subdir per group containing one subdir per project
 - **/projects/[group]/[project]/** contains a clone of the project allowing easy browsing

A review directory contains:
- **_INFO**: all metadata linked to the review (author, reviewers, scores)
- all patched files (including the commit message, named commit). The format is the one of diff patch + comments
- **_DISCUSSION**: a summary of the discussion so far
- **_REVIEW.tmp**: a temporary file listing all comments not published so far

Moving \_REVIEW.tmp to REVIEW should publish the comments to gerrit.

Patched files are in diff format (with some context). Comments are prefixed by @[author]. Opening a new line, will create a new comment on the line above.

Of course this interface is going to change before being stabilized.
